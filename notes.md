## Analysis of sample-1187.eml

#### I used *PhishTool software* to analyse this phishing email.

#### The 'From' email address local-part jbkellyjowl is not the same as the display-name Proton Mail Alert notification@proton.me provided in the email.

#### The display name is "Proton Mail Alert notification@proton.me", suggesting it’s from Proton Mail, but the actual sender is <jbkellyjowl@gmail.com>.

#### This indicates spoofing: the sender is using a Gmail address to impersonate Proton Mail, a common phishing tactic to appear legitimate.

#### when I hover over the the button to Login, it takes me to a malicious link and not to the Proton login page.
