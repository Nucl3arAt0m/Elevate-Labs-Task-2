## Analysis of sample-1187.eml

### I used *PhishTool software* to analyse this phishing email.

### The 'From' email address local-part jbkellyjowl is not the same as the display-name Proton Mail Alert notification@proton.me provided in the email.

### The display name is "Proton Mail Alert notification@proton.me", suggesting it’s from Proton Mail, but the actual sender is <jbkellyjowl@gmail.com>.

### This indicates spoofing: the sender is using a Gmail address to impersonate Proton Mail, a common phishing tactic to appear legitimate.
